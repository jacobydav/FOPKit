Programming the ATTiny85

The pdfs from high-low tech in the Resources folder are very good. I am using Arduino 1.6.4. The ATTiny boards were already added. I must have done it at some point. The circuit for connecting Arduion to ATTiny85 worked just as they showed in their diagram.

The only troubles I had were from the confusing pin labelling. Some people use the physical pin number, others use the IO number.

I have examples of reading analog values from the potentiometer in AnalogInputTest_ATTiny85.ino. Most of the basic Arduino IDE functions are working
with the ATTiny85.

I am using the ATTiny85 at 1Mhz.


NOTES on FOB PCB V1
Received the boards on 6/30/17
Assembly:
Wire holes for the LEDs could be a tiny bit bigger. This would make it easier to get the wires in.

Larger copper ring around wire holes and potentiometer holes would help.
