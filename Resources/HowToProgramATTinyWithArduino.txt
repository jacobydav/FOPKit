How to program an ATTiny85 using an Arduino Uno



1. Open Arduino 1.8.2. I have already added the ATTiny85 library to this version.

2. Open the ArduinoISP sketch from the examples sketches.

3. Before connecting the ATTiny programming board, upload the sketch to the Uno as usual. (Select
	com port, and Uno board and AvrISP mkII as programmer)

4. Connect the ATTiny programming board to the Arduino.

I have re-purposed a prototype board to use as a programmer.
To use it, connect the correct Arduino pins to the Screw terminals. The labels
for each screw terminal are written on them.

Insert the ATTiny85 in the DIP socket.

5. Open the sketch you want to load to the ATTiny 85

The code for Fiber Optic Painting is PWMTwinkle_ATTiny85.ino

6. Change the Board option to ATTiny under Tools in the Arduino IDE.

7. Change the Processor option to ATTiny85 under Tools in the Arduino IDE.
	Clock should be set to 1MHz.
	
8. Change the programmer option to Arduion as ISP.

9. Upload the code.
